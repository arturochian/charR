# charR

`charR` is an R package which makes it possible to use CharAnalysis directly from R.  It also provides methods for estimating the reliability of peak detection in CharAnalysis.

## Installation

`charR` is not currently available on CRAN, but it can be installed from GitHub using the `devtools` package.

```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("kferris10/charR")
```

Right now all the functions work, and that's as far as I've gotten.  Now, we just need to document them.
